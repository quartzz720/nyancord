# Nyancord Demo

This project is a small demonstration of a chat server built with FastAPI and WebSockets. It is **not** a full Discord replacement but illustrates a minimal subset of functionality.

## Features
- Create channels dynamically
- Send and receive messages in real time via WebSockets
- Simple HTML/JavaScript client

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
